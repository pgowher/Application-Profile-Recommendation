# Application Profile Recommendation

In this project, we went through a complete data science workflow:
1. We started by clarifying the goal of our project.
2. We collected relevant data.
3. We cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.
4. We analyzed the cleaned data.

For this project, we'll pretend we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. The company makes apps available on Google Play and in the App Store.

The company only build apps that are free to download and install, and its main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of company's apps determines the revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data obtained from `Google Play` store and `Apple App` store to help the company understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
