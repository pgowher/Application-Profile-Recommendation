    "# Project: Profitable App Type Recommendation for a Company\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Summary\n",
    "As data analysts, we are hired by a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We have been tasked with helping a team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build. The goal is to increase revenue by attaracting more and more app users. We achieve this by finding mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Company Profile\n",
    "The company builds apps that are free to download and install, and the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the revenue generated by any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use that particular app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source: Opening and Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "As of February 2022, there were approximately `2.3 million iOS apps` available on the `App Store`, and `3.5 million Android apps` on `Google Play` as per [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/). Collecting and analyzing data about all these apps (which is almost 6 million apps) requires a lot of time and resources. As this project is being carried out by a single person, so for the purpose of reducing the time and other resources required, we will consider only a subset of these applications. Rather than collecting data and creating a new dataset (which will be again a cubersome task for a single person), we will be using two datasets available online free of cost at [Kaggle-GooglePlay](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and [Kaggle-AppStore](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps).\n",

Out of this data, we will need to identify what data fields will help us to identify the type of apps that are the most successful ones on both the platforms.
